  "text": "## Page 29\n\nNational Classification of Occupations – 2015 Introduction\n\nNOS defines the measurable performance outcomes required from an individual engaged in a\n\nparticular task. NOS lists down what an individual should know and do while performing a\n\nparticular task.\n\nThe SSCs play a pivotal role in linking the gap between what the industry wants and what should\n\nbe the curriculum for a skilling programme. One of the functions of the SSC is developing skill\n\ncompetency standards and qualifications, which form the National Occupational Standards (NOS).\n\nEssentially NOS are benchmarks of good practice. The set of NOS for a job role is called a QP or\n\nQualification Packs. The Government has clearly stated that the SSCs will provide their sector-\n\nspecific competency frameworks or Qualification Packs, which help in both the creation of\n\ncurriculum and assessments.\n\nAs the NCO is a comprehensive repository for national occupations, all the QPs released by the\n\nvarious sector/industries through NSDC are mapped to the job roles in the NCO 2015. A QP NOS\n\nin the NCO 2015 is aligned to a job role wherever an exact match is found. A new job role was\n\nadded to the NCO where there was no description of a job role specified as per a given QP NOS.\n\nThus, all the QPs released by the various SSCs are mapped and added during the creation of NCO\n\n2015. The NCO 2015 would be updated as and when new QPs are released by the SSCs. The\n\nEmployment wing of DGE&T will undertake any alignment of QP NOS to NCO –2015 in the future.\n\n2.3 Outline of the Revision Exercise\n\nA five step approach was followed to update the existing NCO – 2004. The exercise was to align\n\nthe job roles in NCO – 2004 to ISCO – 2008 and also map the job roles to various sectors and\n\nindustries along with the existing NIC – 2008. The NCO job roles were also classified into jobs that\n\nwere relevant, needed any modification or were completely obsolete. The Qualification Packs\n\n(QP) released by National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) were also mapped to the NCO –\n\n2015 job roles.\n\nVOLUME I 17",
