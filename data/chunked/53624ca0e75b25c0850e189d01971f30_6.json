The Ministry is implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a Mission\n\nMode Project for modernising and transforming the network of employment exchanges and\n\nModel Career Centres are being set up in collaboration with States.

The NCO Codes are integrally enmeshed in the NCS initiative\n\nand facilitates efficient job matching. The NCO Codes may be used by varied stakeholders in\n\nmaking information in the employment market more transparent and objective. Soft copies\n\nof the publication is available on the NCS portal.\n\n6. The NC0-2015 series has been evolved along with career content to contribute to the\n\nknowledge repository of career options. More details on the classification, as well as the\n\nprinciples, scope and structure of the classification are available on the National Career\n\nService (www.ncs.gov.in) platform.
