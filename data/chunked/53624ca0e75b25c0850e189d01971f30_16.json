Similarly, drivers have been grouped together, and so are\n\nthose engaged in services.\n\nThe branch of economic activity (industry), in which a job occurs, did not affect the classification\n\nof occupations in the NCO – 68.\n\nHowever, this classification system did not take into account the skill involved in the performance\n\nof various occupations. This means, in effect, that occupations having similar nature of work,\n\nthough requiring varied levels of skill for their performance, were grouped together.\n\n1.4 National Classification of Occupations (NCO) 2004\n\nAfter a gap of about 3 decades the NCO – 04 was brought out. During this period, the economic,\n\nsocial, industrial, and agrarian fields underwent drastic changes. Globalization and economic\n\nliberalization had infused competitiveness amongst various industries. This led to changes in the\n\nwork process and skill level of the workers. This also brought in a totally new class of jobs and\n\nfunctions.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) revised ISCO – 66 on the recommendation of the\n\nInternational Conference of Labour Statisticians and brought out ISCO – 88. It was developed to\n\nfacilitate international comparisons of occupational statistics and to serve as a model for\n\ncountries developing or revising their national occupational classifications. The ILO came out with\n\na new version wherein not only the work performed, but also the skill level required was\n\nconsidered in the codification of occupations.\n\nISCO – 88 had three main aims namely:\n\ni. To facilitate international communication about occupations by supplying national\n\nstatisticians with a tool to make national occupational data available internationally\n\nVOLUME I 4",
