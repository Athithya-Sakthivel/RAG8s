The first code indicates the\n\nDivision in which the job falls under. The first and second code indicates the Sub-Division under\n\nwhich the job role falls. The first three digits make up the Group of the job role, and the first four\n\ndigits together make the Family under which the job role is categorized. The last two digits\n\nindicate the unique code for that particular job role. Disaggregation after Family have been made\n\nto accommodate initially up to nine ‘two digit’ codes within each Family keeping a provision for\n\naccommodating up to 99 Occupations in each Family.\n\nIn a Family, the relation between occupations was determined by the similarity of characteristics\n\nof work done and the level of skill. The most important feature of a Family was that the\n\nOccupations included were closely related to each other than to Occupations outside the Family.\n\nThe last two digits of the code numbers for the individual Occupations within a Family were\n\nnumbered in sequence, usually leaving intervals of 5 or 10 between numbers depending on the\n\nnumber of Occupations to be accommodated within the Family. This also left a scope for\n\naccommodating any new Occupations that maybe identified later without disturbing the basic\n\ncode structure. Shorter intervals between the code numbers of two consecutive Occupations\n\nVOLUME I 13",
