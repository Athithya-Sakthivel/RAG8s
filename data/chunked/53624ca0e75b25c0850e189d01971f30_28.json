It is important therefore that all those who seek employment be\n\nconnected to those who provide it, and sustain them in employment. To address this element,\n\nDGE&T created a central portal that will cross-connect the employee to the employer. This portal,\n\nafter revision of the NCO, will have relevant and comparative information that will assist\n\npotential jobseekers to understand, evaluate, and decide on a suitable career entry.\n\n2.2 Mapping the QP NOS to the Job Roles in NCO 2015\n\nIn India, general education and vocational education training have been operating as separate\n\nverticals with little interaction between the two. In order to facilitate mobility from vocational to\n\ngeneral education, and vice-versa, a national qualification framework was developed.\n\nThe National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) was brought out by National Skill\n\nDevelopment Agency. NSQF is based on an outcome-based approach and each level in the NSQF\n\nis defined and described in terms of competency levels that need to be achieved. The job roles\n\ncorresponding to each of these competency levels would be ascertained with the involvement of\n\nthe industry through the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs).\n\nThe use of NSQF will make it easier for the institutes, students, and employers to pursue a\n\nparticular course and address the issues of inequity and disparity in qualifications. As a\n\ncompetency-based and outcome-based qualification framework, NSQF will facilitate Recognition\n\nof Prior Learning (RPL). NSQF will also help to align Indian qualifications to international\n\nqualifications.\n\nThe National Occupational Standards (NOS) is one of the most important contributions of the\n\nNational Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) to the skills environment of India. This was done\n\nin affiliation with the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). The SSCs are the national partnership\n\norganization with NSDC that bring together all the stakeholders – industry, labour, and the\n\nacademia.\n\nVOLUME I 16",
