International Classification of Occupations\n\nNCO 2004 followed a six digit coding structure with a decimal after the first four digits. The first\n\nfour are single digit representation of Division, Sub-Division, Group, and Family respectively. The\n\nlast two digits of the code, after the decimal, denote the individual Occupation. NCO 2004 was\n\nbased on ISCO 1988 and it is almost a decade since it was updated. Meanwhile, ILO has also\n\npublished a revised version of ISCO in 2008. Many changes have taken place in the economic,\n\nsocial, industrial, and agrarian fields and have resulted in creation of new jobs and functions in\n\nthe Indian labour market during this period.\n\nIn order to understand and incorporate the best practices across the world, five international\n\nOccupational Classifications were studied along with NCO 2004 as specified below:\n\n1. International Labour Organization – International Standard Classification of Occupations\n\n(ISCO)\n\n2. United States of America – Standard Occupation Classification (SCO)\n\n3. Australia & New Zealand – Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of\n\nOccupations (ANZCO)\n\n4. Germany – Klassifikation der Berufe (KlDB)\n\n5. Canada – National Occupational Classification\n\nVOLUME I 20",
