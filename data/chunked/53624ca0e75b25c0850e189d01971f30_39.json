There can be a maximum of\n\n99 Occupations under each Family. There can be a maximum of 99 QP NOS references per\n\nOccupation.\n\nConsidering the dynamics of the labour market and addition of new QP NOS by the SSCs over a\n\nperiod of time, the NCO 2015 codes would be reviewed and updated periodically. This eight\n\ndigit coding structure provides ample scope for addition of Families or Occupations to the NCO, if\n\nrequired, in the future.\n\n4.2 Mapping the Job Roles to the Sectors/Industry\n\nOnce the job roles/occupations were mapped as per ISCO 2008, they were also classified as per\n\nthe sector/industry in which they fit. This mapping will help the Career Counsellors to guide a\n\njobseeker in gaining the correct job as per the relevant sector. Thus, all the job roles in the newly\n\ncreated NCO 2015 were mapped to the relevant sectors. The data generated was then shared\n\nwith experts from the industries for validation.\n\n4.2.1 Mapping the Job Roles to NIC\n\nVOLUME I 27",
