  "text": "## Page 42\n\nNational Classification of Occupations – 2015 Introduction\n\nThe aim of the Government is to ensure that the aspiring youth of India pursue the right career\n\nchoice. Keeping this in mind the main objective of the DGE&T is career counselling. Career\n\ncounselling will not only help the youth to choose the right job for them, but will also help with\n\nbetter skills for enhancing growth and development. Taking this forward, DGE&T and\n\nGovernment have taken-up the task of establishing a knowledge repository within the National\n\nCareer Service Project (NCSP). This knowledge repository shall act as a common, centralized\n\nplatform to provide career-related information to career counsellors and aspirants across the\n\ncountry. This repository will not only store data, but will also link jobs with the appropriate\n\nindustrial sectors. Occupations listed and mapped under NCO – 2015 will act as the beginning\n\npoint of creating career content, which will then form a part of the knowledge repository of the\n\nNational Career Service (NCS) Portal.\n\nThe aim of the NCSP is:\n\nTo provide gainful employment to all jobseekers registered with Employment Exchanges\n\nTo facilitate interaction between jobseekers and employers\n\nTo disseminate accurate and consistent employment market information to all\n\nstakeholders on time\n\nThe NCSP, therefore, is a comprehensive and multipronged transformational project with the\n\nfollowing key aspects:\n\n5.1.1 Model Career Centres (MCC)\n\nThe aim is to transform the current Employment Exchange Offices into Career Counselling\n\nCentres. These career centres would serve as a one-stop-shop for all career related needs of the\n\nyouth and students seeking counselling and employment. These career centres shall undertake all\n\nthe activities related to NCSP i.e. establishing inter-linkages with industry for managing the\n\ndemand side while on the other hand providing counselling and job assistance services to the\n\nsupply side.\n\nVOLUME I 30",
