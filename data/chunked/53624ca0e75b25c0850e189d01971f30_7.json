The codes are used for classification\n\nof occupations by the employment exchanges and census/survey organisations of the\n\nCentral and State government. These codes are revised from time to time to capture the\n\nchanges in occupational patterns and structural changes in the economy. The codes also\n\nhelp in promoting International comparability of statistical data relating to occupations. The\n\nfirst set of occupation standards (ISCO) was brought out by the International Labour\n\nOrganisation (ILO) in 1958 and revised from time to time, the latest being the 2008 series.\n\nThe corresponding series in the Indian National Classification of Occupation (NCO) were\n\n1958, 1967 and 2004. These occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical\n\napproach having major, minor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the\n\nyears to capture the structural changes in the employment market. The NCO codes are\n\nextensively used by the employment exchanges and other data/survey collection agencies\n\nlike the Ministry of Statistics & Pl (NSSO, CSO), Census Commissioner & RGI, NITI Aayog,\n\nAMR, State Governments, Academic Institutions etc.\n\n2. The current national series (NCO-2004) was based on the ISCO-1988 series and\n\nrequired updation to capture information on the new occupations that have emerged,\n\nespecially on account of liberalisation and globalisation. In the meanwhile, the Ministry\n\nbegan implementing the National Career Service as a Mission Mode Project for modernising\n\nand transforming the network of employment exchanges and 100 Model Career Centres are\n\nbeing set up in collaboration with States. The NCS Portal is operational at www.ncs.gov.in\n\nand aims to link job seekers with employment opportunities along with rich career content.\n\nJ3.J1=J\n\nwFcffi\n\n~ ~-110001\n\n3i!lc0<'1,\n\n~urm\\\n\nTele : 91-11-23 71 02 65\n\n'+fRtl\n\n\"ff#rq\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR EMPLOYMENT\n\nFax : 91-11-23 35 56 79\n\nSHANKAR AGGARWAL,\n\nSHRAM SHAKTI BHAVAN\n\nE-mail :secy-labour@nic.in\n\nNEW DELHI-110001\n\nSecretary to Govt. of India\n\nD.O.
