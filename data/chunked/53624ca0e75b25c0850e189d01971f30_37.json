NCO – 2015 Coding Structure\n\nThere have been numerous changes in the international sphere, which have been captured in the\n\nISCO 2008 and other international standards. It was necessary to review the coding structure of\n\nNCO to accommodate the changing labour market environment in the country as well as globally.\n\nThis was done with the help of the National Competency Framework (NSQF), which is an\n\noutcome-based approach and functions through the qualifications pack – QP NOS. Based on the\n\nanalysis of the abovementioned international classifications and the factors impacting skill and\n\nlabour environment in India, an enhanced framework for the NCO was created. This framework\n\nincorporates the following:\n\nType of occupation\n\nSkill level needed for the occupation\n\nLinkage to the QP NOS and NSQF levels\n\nTo accommodate the linkage to QP NOS, an 8 digit coding structure was suggested. An expert\n\ncommittee was established to review and accept the suggested 8 digit coding structure for NCO –\n\n2015. This coding structure was based on the NCO 2004 coding structure mapped and aligned\n\nto ISCO – 2008 with the addition of 2 digits, which will represent the QP NOS.\n\nThe coding structure of NCO 2015 is as follows:\n\nRepresentation Corresponding Mapping to\n\nCoding Structure NCO 2015 Digits\n\nISCO 2008\n\nThe first digit Division Major Group\n\nThe first two digits Sub-Division Sub-Major Group\n\nThe first three digits Group Minor Group\n\nThe first four digits Family Unit Group\n\nThe first two digits after the decimal Occupation\n\nVOLUME I 25",
