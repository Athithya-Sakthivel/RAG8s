The\n\nnomenclature for different levels of aggregation is as under:\n\nNCO – 68 ISCO – 88 NCO – 2004\n\nDIVISION MAJOR GROUP DIVISION\n\nGROUP SUB-MAJOR GROUP SUB-DIVISION\n\nFAMILY MINOR GROUP GROUP\n\n- - - UNIT GROUP FAMILY\n\n1.4.9 Finalization and Codification\n\nThe focus in NCO – 2004 was on the skills required to carry out the tasks and duties of an\n\noccupation and not on whether the worker holding a particular occupation was more skilled than\n\nanother worker in the same occupation. In case of multi-skill occupations, the coding was done\n\non the basis of the predominant skill required to perform the tasks in a job role.\n\nAll the 2945 Occupations (both existing and newly identified) were grouped together according to\n\ncombinations of specific duties, tasks, and work functions. They were grouped in such a way that\n\nthe job roles performed were the same or closely related. Each occupation was assigned a six\n\ndigit code, a distinct title (in some cases alternative titles have also been provided), and a\n\ndefinition.\n\nVOLUME I 12",
