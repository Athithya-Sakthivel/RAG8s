National Classification of Occupations – 2015\n\nGlobalization of the labour market has increased the demand for internationally comparable\n\noccupational data for both statistical and administrative purposes. In India, there is a huge gap\n\nbetween jobseekers and job providers, training institutions, and related industries. In the last ten\n\nyears, there has been a sea of change in almost all the sectors as most jobs have become\n\nmechanized or computerized. These changes need to reflect in the NCO as well. Therefore, the\n\nfirst step to achieve the vision of connecting youth with job opportunities was to create a fresh\n\nnew repository of occupations.\n\nIn 2015, Training wing of DGE&T has become a part of the Ministry of Skills Development and\n\nEntrepreneurship whereas the Employment wing is responsible for NCO – 2015.\n\nThe main objectives of updating the NCO are:\n\nTo create a useful model for the development of National Classifications of Occupations\n\n(NCO)\n\nTo make NCO – 2015 compatible to ISCO – 2008 so that it is relevant for international\n\nreporting, comparisons, and exchange of statistical and administrative information about\n\noccupations\n\n2.1 Need for Revision\n\nCurrently, the employability and vocational skills upgradation sectors in India are undergoing a\n\nparadigm shift. The dynamics and outlook towards labour is increasingly becoming market-\n\nresponsive and driven by constantly evolving needs. Simultaneously, the employment\n\naspirational quotient and needs of individuals who seek employment have already evolved and\n\nare closely aligned with global trends and factors. Aligning to these factors and requirements, the\n\nDGE&T has envisioned a multidimensional approach for evolution.\n\nDGE&T envisaged aligning and upgrading NCO – 2004 using the guided baseline provided by ISCO\n\n– 2008. The need for this revision was to get accurate data from the market along with research\n\ninto sectors/industries and to identify the size and profile of the sectors/industries, types of\n\noccupations, key trends, developments, and opportunities for progression.\n\nVOLUME I 15",
