Apart from being the\n\nstandard industrial classification, NIC is widely used by the government agencies, industry\n\nassociations, and researchers for various administrative, analytical, and research purposes. Thus\n\nlinking or mapping the NCO 2015 would encompass not only the broad-based economic\n\nactivities, but also all the job roles that would be a part of these activities.\n\nNIC 2008 coding is based on economic activities under various sectors/industries. The activities\n\nare broadly classified under various sectors/industries. This classification does not accommodate\n\nevery job role in a sector. Currently NIC 2008 has 21 sections (A to U) corresponding to the\n\nvarious sectors. All the NCO 2015 Occupations have been classified as per sectors and mapped\n\nto NIC 2008. There are certain occupations that may feature in more than one sector. For\n\nexample, the occupation of Storyboard Artist (NCO 2015 Code: 2166.0209), which has QP NOS\n\nReference of Media & Entertainment SSC - MES/Q0507, has employment prospect in multiple\n\neconomic activities such as activities of individual writers for all subjects including fictional\n\nwriting, technical writing, etc. (NIC 2008 Code: 90004), Publishing of computer games for all\n\nplatforms (NIC 2008 Code: 58203), and Video Production (NIC 2008 Code: 59112).\n\n4.3 Classifying the Job Roles\n\nNCO 2015 defines and describes various occupations available in the country giving them\n\nstandard and alternative occupational titles.
