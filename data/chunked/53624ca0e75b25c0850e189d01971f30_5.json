  "text": "FOREWORD\n\nNational Classification of Occupation (NCO) plays a very vital role in maintaining\n\nstandards of occupation in the country and is regularly used in the network of employment\n\nexchanges that constitute the Public Employment Service for Classification of Occupations,\n\njob postings and job search. This classification is used in all types of censuses and sample\n\nsurveys conducted in India especially in data collection, processing, analysis and presentation\n\nof survey results besides its wide range of applications in policy formulation and policy\n\nanalysis. The Directorate General of Employment, Ministry of Labour & Employment,\n\nGovernment of India is responsible for maintaining and updating the National Classification\n\nof Occupation in India aligned with the corresponding International Standard Classification of\n\nOccupations (ISCO) of ILO. The first classification was NCO-1946 followed by NCO-1958, NCO-\n\n1968, NCO-2004 and now the current series NCO-2015. The National Classification of\n\nOccupations-2015 (NCO-2015) is aligned with International Standard Classification of\n\nOccupations-2008 (ISCO-2008).\n\n2. NCO is a classification of occupations which describes and assigns codes to the various\n\noccupations in the country and aligns it with the ISCO. These codes are reviewed and updated\n\nperiodically to reflect developments in the labour market, particularly with the emergence of\n\nnew occupations, as well as to align with changes in the international standard. These codes\n\nalso help in promoting international comparability of statistical data relating to occupations.\n\nThese occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical approach having major,\n\nminor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the years to capture the\n\nstructural changes in the employment market and current work practices and work\n\nenvironment.\n\n3. The NCO-2015 is a compendium for occupational information available in the Indian\n\neconomy. The document gives an insight into the occupational framework, nature of duties\n\ninvolved and the level of skill requirement to perform the activities in a real time work\n\nsituation. The users of NCO may make use of the information for vocational guidance, career\n\ncounselling and various surveys and studies undertaken by user agencies. The NCO-2015 has\n\nalso been mapped with the National Industrial Classification (NIC) and Qualification Packs-\n\nNational Occupational Standards (QP-NOS) to cater to the structural changes in the labour\n\nmarket. Furthermore, NCO-2015 framework is dynamic enough to capture and reflect the\n\nnewly emerging occupations in the industry.\n\n4, The current volume of NCO details out the job description of 3600 civilian occupations\n\ncovering 52 sectors, as compared to the earlier series of NCO i.e. NCO-2004, which contained\n\nthe job descriptions for 2945 occupations. The NCO-2015 has 8 digit coding structure which\n\nwas mapped and aligned to ISCOâ€”2008 with the addition of 2 digits. There is one to one\n\ncorrespondence between ISCO-2008 and the NCO-2015 with the first digit representing the\n\nDivision (Major Group), second digit representing Sub-Division (Sub-Major Group), third digit\n\nrepresenting the Group (Minor Group) and the fourth digit representing the Family (Unit\n\nGroup}, a decimal is introduced after the first four digits in order to create a distinction\n\nbetween the Families and individual Occupations. The NCO-2015 is in two Volumes viz. Vol |\n\n& Il (A& B) where Vol I gives the abstract of Occupations along with their concordance to the\n\nearlier NCO-2004. Vol Il gives the detailed descriptions of the occupations.\n\nanalysis. The Directorate General of Employment, Ministry of Labour Employment,\n\nOccupations (ISCO) of ILO.
