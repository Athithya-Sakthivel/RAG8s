The ILO introduced a number of changes in the ISCO – 58 viz. called it ISCO\n\n– 66, applied the principle of ‘type of work performed’ more rigidly, and revised the Major,\n\nMinor, and Unit Groups (corresponding to NCO Divisions, Groups, and Families) of the\n\nclassification. In order to ensure that NCO – 68 is compatible with ISCO – 66, DGE&T revised the\n\ncode structure so that the new NCO, called NCO – 68, would be patterned after the ISCO – 66.\n\nWhile adopting the ISCO – 66 code structure, deviations were made, wherever necessary, to suit\n\nthe Indian conditions and settings.\n\nThis edition attempted to group together occupations according to similarity of work performed\n\nand contained information about 2484 occupations on the following hierarchical pattern:\n\n8 Occupational Divisions (one digit code number)\n\n95 Occupational Groups (two digit code number)\n\n462 Occupational Families (three digit code number)\n\n2484 Occupations (five digit code number)\n\nThis was a 5 digit classification system, which gave a unique title to every occupation (called the\n\nStandard Title) and in some cases alternative titles have also been given. This classification gave\n\ndefinitions of the occupations, a brief outline of the main tasks, and functions of each occupation\n\nthus bringing out the difference between one occupation and another.\n\nIn this classification system, the grouping of occupations was based on the fundamental criteria\n\nof ‘type of work performed’. Accordingly, occupations were classified in the NCO – 68 so that all\n\nthe workers engaged in the same type of work are grouped together irrespective of the industrial\n\nclassification of establishments where they are engaged. For example, all clerical workers have\n\nbeen classified in one occupational group whether they are engaged in a factory, mine,\n\nVOLUME I 3",
