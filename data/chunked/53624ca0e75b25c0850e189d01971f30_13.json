The\n\npreparation of a classification group means the creation of an exhaustive and structured set of\n\nmutually exclusive and well-described categories often presented as a hierarchy that is reflected\n\nby the numeric or alphabetical codes assigned to them.\n\nClassification of occupation is used in the national context for the collection and dissemination of\n\nstatistics from sources such as population censuses, labour market surveys, employer surveys,\n\nand other sources. It is also used by the Government and other organizations in activities such as\n\nadministration of worker’s compensation, matching jobseekers with job vacancies, and\n\nmanagement of employment-related migration.\n\nThe classification of occupation is a categorization of individual occupations on the kind of work\n\nand skill-level involved in that particular occupation. It is intended that all the job titles in the\n\nnation can be assigned to one (and only one) of these categories or codes.\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\nNCO 2015\n\n| NCO 2004\n\nNCO 2004\n\nNCO 1968\n\nNCO 1958\n\n) NCO 1946\n\nNCO 1946\n\n| 1946\n\n| 1988\n\n| 2008\n\n1946 1958 1968 1988 2004 2008 2015\n\n- ISCO 1958\n\nISCO 1958\n\n| ISCO 1968\n\nISCO 1968\n\nISCO 1988\n\n- ISCO 2008\n\nISCO 1988 ISCO 2008\n\nVOLUME I 1",
