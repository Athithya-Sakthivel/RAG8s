"""
Entrypoint module for KubeRay serveConfigV2.import_path.

This module is copied into the image and must be importable by the operator.
It tries to be idempotent: importing repeatedly (as KubeRay may do) will not
create duplicates; it also exposes `app` symbol for compatibility.

Behavior:
- If running under a normal Python process, attempt to start Serve and deploy
  the Embedder and Reranker servicers. This path is useful for local dev.
- When used by KubeRay, import triggers are sometimes used by the controller;
  our code is defensive and idempotent.
